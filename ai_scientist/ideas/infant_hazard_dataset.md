## TL;DR
I want to develop an AI model to detect infant dangers (e.g., entering a staircase) using a Tapo camera. However, real data of dangerous scenes is ethically difficult to collect. This research will study the optimal method to generate a synthetic infant dataset optimized for the specific viewpoint and distortion of the Tapo camera (from the `baby_monitor` project) using generative AI like Stable Diffusion.

## Abstract
Infant safety monitoring systems using home network cameras (Tapo cameras) and AI are crucial for preventing entry into dangerous areas. Training these AI models (e.g., MobileNet SSD) requires a dataset of infants under various conditions, especially data for specific dangerous scenarios like "entering a hazardous area (curtains or stairs)." However, collecting real data of such dangerous scenes is extremely difficult from privacy and ethical standpoints.

To compensate for this data shortage, synthetic data using Generative AI is gaining attention. However, simply generated images (e.g., "a baby crawling") differ significantly from the specific viewpoint, lens distortion (corrected by `calibration_data.npz`), and home lighting environment of the Tapo camera used in the `baby_monitor` project. Therefore, it is highly likely that such simple synthetic data will not improve the AI model's detection accuracy as expected (ICBINB).

This research focuses on this "gap between the Tapo camera's real environment and synthetic data" and will investigate the optimal synthetic dataset generation method to maximize the accuracy of the infant safety monitoring AI.

Experiments will compare the hazard detection accuracy on test data mimicking the real Tapo camera's viewpoint after training object detection models on datasets generated by the following methods:

1.  **Simple Image Generation (Baseline):** General infant images generated by Stable Diffusion, etc.
2.  **Pose-Conditioned Generation:** Images generated by specifying dangerous poses (e.g., "pulling to stand," "about to fall") using skeletal information (e.g., OpenPose).
3.  **Environment/Viewpoint-Adapted Generation:** Images generated by considering the `baby_monitor` project's camera calibration data (`calibration_data.npz`) and ArUco marker 3D spatial information, matching the Tapo camera's specific top-down viewpoint and distortion.

The objective of this research is to establish the "best practice for optimal synthetic dataset generation" that maximizes the danger detection accuracy of the Tapo camera-based infant monitoring system while protecting privacy.
